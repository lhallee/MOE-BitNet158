    r"""
    Computes auxiliary load balancing loss as in Switch Transformer - implemented in Pytorch.

    See Switch Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961) for more details. This function implements the loss
    function presented in equations (4) - (6) of the paper. It aims at penalizing cases where the routing between
    experts is too unbalanced.

    Args:
        gate_logits (Union[`torch.Tensor`, Tuple[torch.Tensor]):
            Logits from the `gate`, should be a tuple of model.config.num_hidden_layers tensors of
            shape [batch_size X sequence_length, num_experts].
        attention_mask (`torch.Tensor`, None):
            The attention_mask used in forward function
            shape [batch_size X sequence_length] if not None.
        num_experts (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of experts

    Returns:
        The auxiliary loss.
